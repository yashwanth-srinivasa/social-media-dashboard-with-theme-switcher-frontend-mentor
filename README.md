## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS: Custom functions and properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. prefers-color-scheme: I used it to obtain the default state of the user's browser.
2. localStorage: Used to store the theme of the website over sessions.

### Continued development

I will probably use the same code (although a bit refactored as I gain more experience in JS) to change the theme of a website.

### Useful resources

- [The best light/dark mode theme toggle in JavaScript ](https://dev.to/whitep4nth3r/the-best-lightdark-mode-theme-toggle-in-javascript-368f)by Salam Alam-Naylor on dev.to - I came across this article while perusing ways to toggle the theme of a website; a concise article with a load of information, it helped me optimise the theme switching of a website, when compared to my previous project.
